Handle for Printrbot CNC Beta 01
================================

For this machine: http://printrbot.com/shop/printrbot-cnc-beta-01/

Taking the finger-pain out of carring around cutting edge technology :)

When printing, upright is probably the best way to have the most strength
accross the sharp edge and in general don't create too much overhang. However,
it is important to add enough support material at the bottom for it to stand
securely while printing.
